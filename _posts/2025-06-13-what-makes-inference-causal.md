title: "What makes inference causal?"
---
How do we know that x causes y? The easy answer is "with a randomized, controlled experiment". But sometimes the easy answer is not possible (or, at least, we just can't or won't devote the time and resources to achieving the easy answer. Which when described this way, maybe seems like not the easy answer after all!). 

But the instinct to pursue a randomized, controlled experiment is correct; such a setting ensures that groups being compared are only different in terms of the intervention, on average. We codify this in three major principles of causal inference:

  (1) xxx
  (2) xxx
  (3) xxx

Observational research, where we compare groups with respect to some intervention but subjects were not randomized, complicates getting unbiased effect measurements according to this paradigm. So the trick is to statistically modify our sample to meet these requirements, or to hit upon some great real-world example where this just so happens to be the case--a natural experiment, in other words.  

## Can we think of a real-world scenario that sets up the experiment *for* us? (h2)
