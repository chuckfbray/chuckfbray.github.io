I am a biostatistician and health services researcher at Harvard Medical School's Department of Health Care Policy investigating features of providers, patients, and scenarios that drive health outcomes. I do this through a causal inference framework that leads to robust conclusions about causal relationships between these factors and how patients fare in our health care system [jekyllrb.com](https://jekyllrb.com/)
